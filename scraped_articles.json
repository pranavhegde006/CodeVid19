At least five patients also died overnight, including three in Kabul, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll now stands at 451. There have been 4,201 recoveries. The ministry has so far tested 54,770 patients.\n\n\n\nLocal officials in Kabul have warned that the actual number of infections in the capital is significantly higher than what official figures show.\n\n\n\nThe laboratory which has halted work is located in the western province of Herat, where a number of other patients died overnight, which borders Iran \u2013 previously the centre of the virus.\n\n\n\nThe first case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from the neighbouring country in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined.\n\n\n\nTesting capacity remains low in Afghanistan and experts warn that the actual number of infections is much higher. But, according to a new official plan, testing capacity will be increased in the country while clinics with no testing capacity are to be instructed to announce new patients through their symptoms.\n\n\n\nAhmad Jawad Osmani, the new acting health minister, has warned that a large number of the country\u2019s population is infected with Covid-19.\n\n\n\nOmani called his five-part plan to fight against the virus \u201chistoric\u201d and said \u201conly a small part of health sector was to fight with coronavirus until today, but from now, all parts of the sector will get coordinated to fight against the virus.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, violence continues across the country, with two separate attacks killing at least 18 people amid a wave of violence across the country, local officials have said.\n\nA local police chief in western Ghor, Fakhrudin, said Taliban insurgents stormed a police checkpoint late Friday night and killed 10 police officers.\n\nAccording to the country\u2019s national security council, 89 civilians were killed in Taliban attacks during last two weeks.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile the government has continued to advance the cause of peace, the Taliban continued their campaign of violence against the Afghan people during Eid and the weeks after that. In the last two weeks, they killed 89 civilians and wounded 150 across 29 provinces\u201d said Javid Faisal, spokesman for the office of national security council.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban has rejected the numbers released by the government today about civilian casualties in the last two weeks.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/13/coronavirus-live-news-fauci-warns-against-trump-rallies-health-fears-in-australia-over-blm-protests", "published": "2020-06-13T00:00:00"}]}, "WashingtonPost": {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/", "articles": [{"title": "As coronavirus cases spike, Fauci warns Trump rally attendees that large gatherings are \u2018risky\u2019", "text": "Puerto Rico will lift nearly all of its coronavirus restrictions next week, allowing beaches, churches and movie theaters to reopen even after a jump in infections earlier this month.\n\nStarting Monday, businesses in the U.S. territory will be permitted to operate seven days a week and restaurants can be filled to 50 percent capacity, Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced (PNP) said Thursday.

The territory has seen more than 1,400 confirmed cases and nearly 4,000 probable cases, including at least 144 deaths, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.\n\nThis week, health officials said the island had reached its peak two months ago and urged people to maintain social distancing, noting that restrictions could return if cases go up again.\n\nBut data shows that may already be happening.
